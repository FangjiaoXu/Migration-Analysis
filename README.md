Program Details: 

This website aims to visualise the flow of migration around the world. The data used for the project was acquired from the Facebook Marketing API. Pysocialwatcher, a package for social data collection built on python, was used for collecting the data. The data was collected separately for 231 countries with information regarding expats from 89 different places. Using the same data, we created visualisations using some famous python libraries like matplotlib and folium.
